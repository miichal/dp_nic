	abstract = {Among the various forms of malware, botnets are emerging as the most serious threat against cyber-security as they provide a distributed platform for several illegal activities such as launching distributed denial of service attacks against critical targets, malware dissemination, phishing, and click fraud. The defining characteristic of botnets is the use of command and control channels through which they can be updated and directed. Recently, botnet detection has been an interesting research topic related to cyber-threat and cyber-crime prevention. This paper is a survey of botnet and botnet detection. The survey clarifies botnet phenomenon and discusses botnet detection techniques. This survey classifies botnet detection techniques into four classes: signature-based, anomaly-based, {DNS-based}, and mining-base. It summarizes botnet detection techniques in each class and provides a brief comparison of botnet detection techniques.},

	abstract = {As a key approach to securing large networks, existing anomaly detection techniques focus primarily on network traffic data. However, the sheer volume of such data often renders detailed analysis very expensive and reduces the effectiveness of these tools. In this paper, we propose a light-weight anomaly detection approach based on unproductive {DNS} traffic, namely, the failed {DNS} queries, with a novel tool - {DNS} failure graphs. A {DNS} failure graph captures the interactions between hosts and failed domain names. We apply a graph decomposition algorithm based on the tri-nonnegative matrix factorization technique to iteratively extract coherent co-clusters (dense subgraphs) from {DNS} failure graphs. By analyzing the co-clusters in the daily {DNS} failure graphs from a 3-month {DNS} trace captured at a large campus network, we find these co-clusters represent a variety of anomalous activities, e.g., spamming, trojans, bots, etc.. In addition, these activities often exhibit distinguishable subgraph structures. By exploring the temporal properties of the co-clusters, we show our method can identify new anomalies that likely correspond to unreported domain-flux bots.},

Events that compromise the security of {DNS} can have a significant impact on the Internet since they can affect its availability and its intended operation. This paper describes algorithms used to monitor and detect certain types of attacks to the {DNS} infrastructure using flow data. Our methodology is based on algorithms that do not rely on known signature attack vectors. The effectiveness of our solution is illustrated with real and simulated traffic examples. In one example, we were able to detect a tunneling attack well before the appearance of public reports of it.},
