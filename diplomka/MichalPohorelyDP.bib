@inproceedings{FeiShaRam09,
	Abstract = {Among the various forms of malware, botnets are emerging as the most
	serious threat against cyber-security as they provide a distributed
	platform for several illegal activities such as launching distributed
	denial of service attacks against critical targets, malware dissemination,
	phishing, and click fraud. The defining characteristic of botnets
	is the use of command and control channels through which they can
	be updated and directed. Recently, botnet detection has been an interesting
	research topic related to cyber-threat and cyber-crime prevention.
	This paper is a survey of botnet and botnet detection. The survey
	clarifies botnet phenomenon and discusses botnet detection techniques.
	This survey classifies botnet detection techniques into four classes:
	signature-based, anomaly-based, {DNS-based}, and mining-base. It
	summarizes botnet detection techniques in each class and provides
	a brief comparison of botnet detection techniques.},

@inproceedings{JiaCaoJin10,
	Abstract = {As a key approach to securing large networks, existing anomaly detection
	techniques focus primarily on network traffic data. However, the
	sheer volume of such data often renders detailed analysis very expensive
	and reduces the effectiveness of these tools. In this paper, we propose
	a light-weight anomaly detection approach based on unproductive {DNS}
	traffic, namely, the failed {DNS} queries, with a novel tool - {DNS}
	failure graphs. A {DNS} failure graph captures the interactions between
	hosts and failed domain names. We apply a graph decomposition algorithm
	based on the tri-nonnegative matrix factorization technique to iteratively
	extract coherent co-clusters (dense subgraphs) from {DNS} failure
	graphs. By analyzing the co-clusters in the daily {DNS} failure graphs
	from a 3-month {DNS} trace captured at a large campus network, we
	find these co-clusters represent a variety of anomalous activities,
	e.g., spamming, trojans, bots, etc.. In addition, these activities
	often exhibit distinguishable subgraph structures. By exploring the
	temporal properties of the co-clusters, we show our method can identify
	new anomalies that likely correspond to unreported domain-flux bots.},

@inproceedings{KarMeiHoe06,
	Abstract = {The Domain Name System ({DNS)} is an essential network infrastructure
	component since it supports the operation of the Web, Email, Voice
	over {IP} ({VoIP)} and other business- critical applications running
	over the network. Events that compromise the security of {DNS} can
	have a significant impact on the Internet since they can affect its
	availability and its intended operation. This paper describes algorithms
	used to monitor and detect certain types of attacks to the {DNS}
	infrastructure using flow data. Our methodology is based on algorithms
	that do not rely on known signature attack vectors. The effectiveness
	of our solution is illustrated with real and simulated traffic examples.
	In one example, we were able to detect a tunneling attack well before
	the appearance of public reports of it.},
