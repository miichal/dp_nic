  pages = {268--273},
  abstract = {Among the various forms of malware, botnets are emerging as the most
	serious threat against cyber-security as they provide a distributed
	platform for several illegal activities such as launching distributed
	denial of service attacks against critical targets, malware dissemination,
	phishing, and click fraud. The defining characteristic of botnets
	is the use of command and control channels through which they can
	be updated and directed. Recently, botnet detection has been an interesting
	research topic related to cyber-threat and cyber-crime prevention.
	This paper is a survey of botnet and botnet detection. The survey
	clarifies botnet phenomenon and discusses botnet detection techniques.
	This survey classifies botnet detection techniques into four classes:
	signature-based, anomaly-based, {DNS-based}, and mining-base. It
	summarizes botnet detection techniques in each class and provides
	a brief comparison of botnet detection techniques.},

  booktitle = {2010 18th {IEEE} International Conference on Network Protocols ({ICNP)}},
  year = {2010},
  pages = {144--153},
  abstract = {As a key approach to securing large networks, existing anomaly detection
	techniques focus primarily on network traffic data. However, the
	sheer volume of such data often renders detailed analysis very expensive
	and reduces the effectiveness of these tools. In this paper, we propose
	a light-weight anomaly detection approach based on unproductive {DNS}
	traffic, namely, the failed {DNS} queries, with a novel tool - {DNS}
	failure graphs. A {DNS} failure graph captures the interactions between
	hosts and failed domain names. We apply a graph decomposition algorithm
	based on the tri-nonnegative matrix factorization technique to iteratively
	extract coherent co-clusters (dense subgraphs) from {DNS} failure
	graphs. By analyzing the co-clusters in the daily {DNS} failure graphs
	from a 3-month {DNS} trace captured at a large campus network, we
	find these co-clusters represent a variety of anomalous activities,
	e.g., spamming, trojans, bots, etc.. In addition, these activities
	often exhibit distinguishable subgraph structures. By exploring the
	temporal properties of the co-clusters, we show our method can identify
	new anomalies that likely correspond to unreported domain-flux bots.},
